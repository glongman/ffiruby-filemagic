ffiruby-filemagic
=================

A new implementation of the ancient ruby-filemagic gem (http://grub.ath.cx/filemagic/). 

This version uses FFI to talk to the native library (JRuby friendly).

(Blurb from the original gem site follows)

	What is FileMagic?

		FileMagic is a Ruby binding to the magic(4) library, which you may know better as the file(1) command. 

		The file command identifies the type of a file using, among other tests, a test for whether the file begins with a certain magic number.

Install:

Make sure you have the magic(4) library installed. On OSX this can be done using MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/)

> sudo port install file
> sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
> sudo gem install glongman-otv-ffiruby-filemagic

 - Linux? should just work 
 - Cygwin? no idea, never use it
 - Windows? see above

Usage:

> irb
>> require 'ffiruby-filemagic'
=> true
>> fm = FFIFileMagic.new(FFIFileMagic::MAGIC_MIME)
=> #<FFIFileMagic:0x11a4d9c @cookie=#<Native Pointer address=0x13606f0>>
>> fm.file(rails.png)
=> "image/png"
>>
