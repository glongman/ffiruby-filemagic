ffiruby-filemagic
=================

Win32 Support? sorry.

A new implementation of the ancient ruby-filemagic gem (http://grub.ath.cx/filemagic/). 

This version uses FFI to talk to the native library (JRuby friendly).

(Blurb from the original gem site follows)

What is FileMagic?

	FileMagic is a Ruby binding to the magic(4) library, which you may know better as the file(1) command. 
	The file command identifies the type of a file using, among other tests, a test for whether the file 
        begins with a certain magic number.

Install:

Make sure you have the magic(4) library installed. 

> sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
> sudo gem install glongman-ffiruby-filemagic

After Install:

> irb
>> require 'ffi_file_magic'
=> true
>> fm = FFIFileMagic.new(FFIFileMagic::MAGIC_MIME)
=> #<FFIFileMagic:0x11a4d9c @cookie=#<Native Pointer address=0x13606f0>>
>> fm.file('rails.png') #supply a path to your own image
=> "image/png"
>> 

Install Problems?
 
If the gem complains that it can't find the magic library you can run the setup.rb file
in the root of the gem

> sudo ruby /path/to/ffiruby-filemagic/setup.rb    (where is the gem? 'gem contents ffiruby-filemagic')

Without any arguments setup.rb will look around the filesystem for a magic library and test to see if
that library is compatible. If so a small modification will be made so the gem will work.

You can run setup.rb more than once. 

you can also tell setup.rb exactly where to look for the magic libary

> sudo ruby /path/to/ffiruby-filemagic/setup.rb --with-magic-lib=/opt/local/lib

This gem has been tested with the magic library shipped with File 4.26 from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file

On OSX, and at the time of writing this, you can get file using macports (http://www.macports.org/)

> sudo port install file

On other Unix variants, download the source, build and install. then run setup.rb
